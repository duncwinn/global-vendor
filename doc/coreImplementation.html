<h1>Global Vendor</h1>
<h2>Core Implementation</h2>
<p>
In this post I will discuss the api in a bit more detail, and then talk about the implementation of the core services.
</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>
Before we get started, you will need to download the project and setup your environment. Make sure you have all of the following installed:
</p>

<h4>Required</h4>
<ul>
<li>A Java1.6 VM</li>
<li><a href="www.gradle.org">Gradle</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mcintyred/global-vendor">The Global Vendor Project itself</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>Optional</h4>
All the tests can be run from the command line, but you'll find it easier to use an IDE. The gradle scripts are set up
with Eclipse/STS in mind, but should also work with Intellij.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.springsource.org/sts">Spring Tool Suite</a></li>
<li><a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">Git Source Code Control</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>Advanced</h4>
You will need RabbitMQ for the more advanced configurations, but you don't need to install it just yet.
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a></li>
</ul>

The test deployments use the embedded H2 database, but you can opt to use any other database you choose provided you supply the driver. 
The project comes with a configuration using MySQL.

<h3>Project Structure</h3>
Once you have downloaded the project you should see the following directory structure:
<pre>
   gv-parent/
      gv-api/
      gv-core/
      gv-warehouse-gemfire/
      gv-warehouse-jpa/
      gv-warehouse-node/
      gv-web/
</pre>

<p>In this post we will be discussing the <span class="project">gv-api</span> and <span class="project">gv-core</span> projects.
</p>

<h2>gv-api</h2>
This project defines the service interfaces used by the other projects. It also defines the message formats used by the SOAP Gateway and Spring Batch for file processing.
The main packages in this project are as follows:

<table><tr><th>Package</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>gv.api</td><td>Contains the model objects (DTOs) Warehouse, Product, Order etc</td></tr>
<tr><td>gv.distributor.api</td><td>The service interface for operations which can be performed by distributors</td></tr>
<tr><td>gv.jaxb</td><td>Support classes to help with JAXB marshalling and unmarshalling</td></tr>
<tr><td>gv.orders.api</td><td>The low-level interface to the order management system</td></tr>
<tr><td>gv.products.api</td><td>The interface to the product management system</td></tr>
<tr><td>gv.stock.api</td><td>A trivial StockService interface</td></tr>
<tr><td>gv.test</td><td>Two marker interfaces (UnitTest and IntegrationTest) used with the @Category annotation to group JUnit tests</td></tr>
<tr><td>gv.warehouse.api</td><td>The service interfaces which a warehouse must implement, including messaging DTOs</td></tr>
</table>
